Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high-quality proposals we received for this winter. It’s inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development of privacy-enhancing technology, and we hope that one day we’ll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals that we wish we could.<p>The lineup for this January is set to be really great:<p><p><img alt="Cade" src="../images/cade-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Cade</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/helveticade">@helveticade</a>) Cade is an Australian-based designer. Over his eight year career, he has worked on projects of varying sizes across Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney and Melbourne. Inspired by the challenges faced by early human computer interfaces, Cade’s current work focuses on emerging technology, privacy &amp; security and socially responsible design. He is CoinJar’s Creative Director, and Design Lead for a small design consulting firm, Koyo. Cade writes music and is also completing research into generative music theory.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Natalie Wilkinson" src="../images/natalie-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Natalie Wilkinson</strong> I am a videography student from San Francisco Art Institute, outdoor sports enthusiast, and general lover of things. I will be working on a promotional video for Open Whisper Systems as well as offering my services to the group should they have any ideas for digital media orientated artistic work. I yoga, surf, hike, climb, read palms and Lenormand, sing, listen, speak, poet, photo and video.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Sterling Radcliff" src="../images/sterling-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Sterling Radcliff</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/radcliffx">@radcliffx</a>) Sterling is a software engineer “living” in San Francisco that enjoys skateboarding, hopping freight trains and learning new things.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Yoko Nakano" src="../images/yoko-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Yoko Nakano (Yokz)</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/yknakano">@yknakano</a>) I have been working in the field of Human Computer Interaction for the past eight years as a user researcher, information architect, interaction designer, and a UX designer. I practice and preach design through empathy, collaboration, iteration and validation. On Winter of Code, I’ll be improving the user experience of existing iOS and Android apps as well as lending my hand on concepting new work and helping with the website.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Gregg Horton" src="../images/gregg-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Gregg Horton</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/greggawatt">@greggawatt</a>) Gregg Horton is a developer and conceptual information artist living in Oakland, California. When he’s not writing code you can find him recording narrations of obscure anarchist literature over ambient music, exploring the intersection of surveillance culture and autonomous expression, or rambling through the redwood forest with his German Shepherd Husky mix. He will be building a privacy-conscious replacement for the Google Play store that will utilize his sick JavaScript skills.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Jessy Irwin" src="../images/jessy-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Jessy Irwin</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessysaurusrex">@jessysaurusrex</a>) Jessy is a marketing communications professional working in security in San Francisco. She is an outspoken advocate for stronger privacy and security protections in education, and is currently researching the surveillance taking place in schools across the country. She can be found regularly ranting on Twitter, and her current passions include dinosaurs, big necklaces, tacos and caffeine. <br /><br /> During this year’s Winter of Code, Jessy will be using her knowledge of the “dark arts” of marketing, content strategy and public relations to create content that can be remixed, refactored, patched and reworked to fit the needs of users, contributors and developers. By working on updating site content and making information easier to find, she hopes to create a framework that can help the Open Whisper Systems community continue to grow and flourish. Additionally, she will be working on ways to communicate the importance of security (and the technology behind it) to users who may not understand why encrypted calls and texts are important – just that they need “something else” or “something secure” to use.<p><br /><p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Riley Shaw" src="../images/riley-wboc.png" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Riley Shaw</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyjshaw">@rileyjshaw</a>) Riley has a degree in electrical engineering and spends his time designing and writing software. He’s looking forward to getting nerd-sniped around a table of smart, friendly people at WBoC. He’s an avid kiteboarder, and really perked up when he heard that surfboards would be involved. Riley will be finishing up the interface for TextSecure-Browser and helping out with Bitorzo . Some of his past work can be seen at http://rileyjshaw.com.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Tina Huang" src="../images/tina-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Tina Huang</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kmonkeyjam">@kmonkeyjam</a>) I am a software engineer with a passion for technologies that empower open communications. In the past, I’ve worked on Blogger, Google News, and Twitter, and I love the role open whisper systems plays in providing a secure means of communication. I like building resilient distributed systems, so I’m hoping to make the mobile sign-up process more robust by tracking some stats around SMS confirmations during sign up and improve SMS delivery. I also love to surf, especially when I don’t have to put on a wet suit.<br /><br /><p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Jack Rogers" src="../images/jack-wboc.png" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Jack Rogers</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/jackflips">@jackflips</a>) I’m a CS student at UC Santa Cruz whose interest in privacy tech was sparked after a judge in a hackathon here called my project for protesters “un-American.” I’ll be working on the iOS side of TextSecure and attempting to live up to a mumbled “yeah, I can almost surf.”<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Emily Chao" src="../images/emily-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Emily Chao</strong> I’m a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I’m deeply interested in web development and want to learn more about security, cryptography and user information privacy. I just want to learn about everything technology-related! If not coding, I like singing along to my 4-hour long Spotify playlists and exploring new places. I’ll be helping out on the TextSecure Chrome Extension.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Luke Connolly" src="../images/luke-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Luke Connolly</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kidminded">@kidminded</a>) Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, Luke is an interactive designer and entrepreneur living in New York City. As much a philosopher as a designer, he is curious about the implications that technology has for society and the human psyche. He will provide design support (branding, UI, and UX / product) on this year’s trip.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Joyce Yan" src="../images/joyce-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Joyce Yan</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/joyce_y">@joyce_y</a>) I’m a Silicon Valley native and sophomore studying CS at the University of Southern California.

When not trying to project the lives of others onto small screens, Jake also plays with cryptography in the same way a five-year-old might try to play with industrial construction equipment.<p style="clear: both;" /><p><img alt="Frederic Jacobs" src="../images/fred-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" /> <strong>Frederic Jacobs</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs">@fredericjacobs</a>) Fred is co-leading the iOS development.
