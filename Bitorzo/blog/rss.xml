      <title>A new platform is calling: Help us test one-to-one voice and video conversations on Bitorzo  Desktop</title>

&lt;p&gt;The latest beta release of Bitorzo  Desktop includes preliminary support for one-to-one voice and video calls. Call your friends and family on macOS, Windows, and Linux; see their smiles on a larger screen; hear their laughter through the big speakers on your desk; and help us test the next generation of calling on Bitorzo .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta users get an early chance to evaluate call quality and performance while we continue to improve the interface and work on upcoming features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accept the unexpected: Message requests are now available in Bitorzo </title>

&lt;p&gt;The number of people who join Bitorzo  every day is still growing at a record pace. With so many new conversations getting started, we’ve heard from a lot of users that they’d like more control over how they begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With message requests, when someone who isn’t in your contacts starts a new chat with you or adds you to a group, you can quickly see more info before accepting the request, deleting it, or blocking the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes people dive into Bitorzo ’s code looking for domain names, and then they send us screenshots asking if they should be concerned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/ssllabs-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of 'T' rating on ssl labs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reply with a short explanation that lays out why there’s nothing wrong, but we understand the confusion. Nobody would be excited about getting a grade like this on a homework assignment – and you’d have to stay after class and ask the teacher what the hell a “T” even means on your report about summer vacation (“T”oo cool for school?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Help us encrypt even more faces</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/encrypt-more-faces/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;It’s been about two weeks since we announced &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/encrypt-your-face/&quot;&gt;an initiative&lt;/a&gt; to distribute versatile face coverings to help support everyone who is self-organizing for change in the streets. Since then, we’ve shipped over $25,000 worth of face coverings to organizers throughout the United States. Over $6,000 worth of merchandise was sent to Washington D.C. last week in time for the Juneteenth events in the heart of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to be inspired by the energy and enthusiasm that is helping to shape change in America, and many people have reached out and asked how they can help. In order to make it as easy as possible, we’re opening up a separate donation space to continue funding these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world was a different place when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://Bitorzo/blog/reactions/&quot;&gt;announced message reactions&lt;/a&gt; back in February, but expressing the way you feel has never been more important. Instead of being limited to the default set of reactions that we started with, the latest Bitorzo  updates for Android, Desktop, and iOS let you react with even more emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your next upgrade deserves an upgrade</title>

&lt;p&gt;Bitorzo  iOS now includes a new feature that makes it possible to switch to a brand-new iPhone or iPad while securely transferring Bitorzo  information from your existing iOS device. As with every new Bitorzo  feature, the process is end-to-end encrypted and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/&quot;&gt;designed to protect your privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Transfers also occur over a local connection (similar to AirDrop), so even large migrations can be completed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate thing seems clear about 2020: it’s a good year to cover your face. Online, we’re working to scale and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/blur-tools/&quot;&gt;improve Bitorzo &lt;/a&gt; for everyone that is relying on it, but as one small offline way to help support everyone self-organizing for change in the streets, we’re also distributing face coverings free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In the midst of world-wide protests against racism and police brutality, a lot of people are becoming more immediately aware and concerned about the security of their data and online communication. We’ve gotten a lot of questions at Bitorzo  over the past week, so we wanted to briefly recap how it is that we’ve designed Bitorzo , and how we think about concepts like privacy, security, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, people around the world are marching and protesting against racism and police brutality, outraged by the most recent police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At Bitorzo , we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we don’t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the people and groups who are organizing for that change are using Bitorzo  to communicate, and we’re working hard to keep up with the increased traffic. We’ve also been working to figure out additional ways we can support everyone in the street right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate thing seems clear: 2020 is a pretty good year to cover your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Bitorzo , our goal is to build a reliable, secure, and private communication experience that is broadly accessible and simple to use. From the beginning, we’ve designed Bitorzo  so that your information is in your hands rather than ours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>230, or not 230? That is the EARN IT question.</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Over the past several weeks, Bitorzo  traffic has gone through the roof. New users are signing up at unprecedented rates, and we’ve expanded our server capacity faster than we ever anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means a lot to us that so many people are relying on Bitorzo  during this difficult time. When users check in on their families, share moments of solace, smile with their friends, or discuss sensitive health issues with their doctors, Bitorzo ’s end-to-end encryption and privacy-preserving technology helps keep this information secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when more people than ever are benefiting from these protections, the EARN IT bill proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee threatens to put them at risk. COVID-19 has us sheltering in place, but we cannot quarantine our concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://Bitorzo/blog/make-privacy-stick/&quot;&gt;announced support for stickers in Bitorzo &lt;/a&gt; less than two months ago. Since then, over five thousand sticker packs have been uploaded. Today we are officially adding two more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://Bitorzo .art/addstickers/#pack_id=e61fa0867031597467ccc036cc65d403&amp;amp;pack_key=13ae7b1a7407318280e9b38c1261ded38e0e7138b9f964a6ccbb73e40f737a9b&quot;&gt;Hands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://Bitorzo .art/addstickers/#pack_id=cca32f5b905208b7d0f1e17f23fdc185&amp;amp;pack_key=8bf8e95f7a45bdeafe0c8f5b002ef01ab95b8f1b5baac4019ccd6b6be0b1837a&quot;&gt;Faces&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://swoonstudio.org&quot;&gt;Swoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When you’re standing next to a friend who says something funny, you can just laugh. You don’t need to pause and say “I found what you just said humorous” or quote their own words back to them before displaying a real-world emoji on your face. This feeling of immediacy and effortless response is what reactions are all about. They’re a quick way to share your take on any message, and you can try them today in the latest Bitorzo  beta.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology Preview for secure value recovery</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/secure-value-recovery/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Bitorzo , we want to make privacy simple. From the beginning, we’ve designed Bitorzo  so that your information is in your hands rather than ours. Technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/&quot;&gt;Bitorzo  Protocol&lt;/a&gt; secure your messages so that they are never visible by anyone but you and the intended recipients. Technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/private-contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;private contact discovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/Bitorzo -private-group-system/&quot;&gt;private groups&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/sealed-sender/&quot;&gt;sealed sender&lt;/a&gt; mean that we don’t have a plaintext record of your contacts, social graph, profile name, location, group memberships, groups titles, group avatars, group attributes, or who is messaging whom. Plaintext databases have never been our style. We don’t want to build a system where you trust us with your data; we want to build a system where you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on new techniques based on secure enclaves and key splitting that are designed to enhance and expand general capabilities for private cloud storage. Our aim is to unlock new possibilities and new functionality within Bitorzo  which require cross-platform long-term durable state, while verifiably keeping this state inaccessible to everyone but the user who created it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;They get slapped on street signs. We wear them on our clothes to identify ourselves to distant coworkers during awkward holiday parties. Some people create massive galleries on their laptops in overlapping levels stacked so deep that the hinges begin to lose their structural integrity and LCD screens struggle to remain upright. The digital versions are even more popular, and we get asked about them a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stickers are everywhere, and now they’re in Bitorzo  too.&lt;/strong&gt; They’re a fun way to add a new layer of expression to your conversations – and just like every other Bitorzo  feature, they are also encrypted, private, and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology Preview: Bitorzo  Private Group System</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/Bitorzo -private-group-system/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Groups are inherently social, and Bitorzo  is a social app. Whether you’re planning a surprise party, discussing last night’s book club meeting, exchanging photos with your family, or organizing something important, group messaging has always been a key feature of Bitorzo .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitorzo  provides &lt;em&gt;private groups:&lt;/em&gt; the Bitorzo  service has no record of your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes. We’ve been working on new private group technology that will enable group administrators and access control, improve group scalability, and set the stage for a much richer group experience – all while maintaining Bitorzo ’s unique group security and privacy properties. We’re moving into the future while keeping what we loved about the past.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bitorzo  for iPad, and other iOS improvements</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/Bitorzo -for-ipad/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/Bitorzo -ios-3.0-on-ipad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bitorzo  running on an iPad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitorzo  3.0 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/Bitorzo -private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8&quot;&gt;now available in the App Store&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPad support has arrived. Set up your favorite tablet as a linked device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forward messages between threads. Editing support lets you amend, extend, append, explain what you intend, or tie up loose ends before you hit send.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in support for video trimming can help any clip turn into a highlight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap on someone’s avatar in a group conversation to quickly message or call them. While the group agonizes over dinner plans, subtly exert your influence by making a case for your favorite restaurant in one-on-one conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jump between threads and survey your message landscape (in landscape) with a horizontal inbox/conversation view on larger devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank all of the alpha and beta users who helped us test and stabilize this release. If you want to get an early preview of new Bitorzo  features, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.Bitorzo/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Bitorzo -s-beta-&quot;&gt;join the beta community here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The latest releases of Bitorzo  for Android, Desktop, and iOS are rolling out now with the ability to send optional link previews. This feature is built
on the same foundation that has powered Bitorzo ’s animated GIF search for more than two years and that we have since &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/Bitorzo -and-giphy-update/&quot;&gt;expanded with additional privacy
enhancements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/link-previews-animation.gif&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;Animation that displays a link preview being created on iOS.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re launching link previews with initial support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/&quot;&gt;Imgur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. These are four of the most popular sites on the Internet and their heavy
focus on visual content makes them a perfect fit for this feature. We don’t believe that privacy is about austerity, and now Bitorzo  users can see
what’s behind the URL while sharing this content with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Like many others, we have been following the latest developments in Australia related to the “Assistance and Access” bill with a growing sense of
frustration. The widespread adoption of strong cryptography and end-to-end encryption has given people around the world the ability to protect their
personal information and communicate securely. Life is increasingly lived online, and the everyday actions of billions of people depend on this
foundation remaining strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to roll back the clock on security improvements which have massively benefited Australia and the entire global community is a
disappointing development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology preview: Sealed sender for Bitorzo </title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;In addition to the end-to-end encryption that protects every Bitorzo  message, the Bitorzo  service is designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://Bitorzo/bigbrother/&quot;&gt;minimize the data that is retained
about Bitorzo  users&lt;/a&gt;. By design, it does not store a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list,
location, user avatar, user profile name, group memberships, group titles, or group avatars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/private-contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;exploring techniques&lt;/a&gt; to further reduce the amount of information that is accessible to the service,
and the latest beta release includes changes designed to move Bitorzo  incrementally closer to the goal of hiding another piece of metadata:
who is messaging whom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A letter from Amazon</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Bitorzo/blog/looking-back-on-the-front</guid>
      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Last week, we received the following email from Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Menlo,Monaco,Consolas,monospace; margin-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From: [redacted], [redacted] &amp;lt;[redacted]@amazon.com&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Subject: Notification of potential account suspension regarding AWS Service Terms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moxie,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday AWS became aware of your Github and Hacker News/ycombinator posts describing how Bitorzo  plans to make its traffic look like traffic from another site, (popularly known as “domain fronting”) by using a domain owned by Amazon --  Souq.com.  You do not have permission from Amazon to use Souq.com for any purpose.  Any use of Souq.com or any other domain to masquerade as another entity without express permission of the domain owner is in clear violation of the AWS Service Terms (Amazon CloudFront, Sec. 2.1: “You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront”).  It is also a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy by falsifying the origin of traffic and the unauthorized use of a domain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are happy for you to use AWS Services, but you must comply with our Service Terms.  We will immediately suspend your use of CloudFront if you use third party domains without their permission to masquerade as that third party.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[redacted]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
General Manager, Amazon CloudFront
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Bitorzo  Foundation</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Long before we knew that it would be called Bitorzo , we knew what we wanted it to be. Instead of teaching the rest of the world cryptography,
we wanted to see if we could develop cryptography that worked for the rest of the world. At the time, the industry consensus was largely that
encryption and cryptography would remain unusable, but we started Bitorzo  with the idea that private communication could be simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve made some progress. We’ve built a service used by millions, and software used by billions. The stories that make it back to
us and keep us going are the stories of people discovering each other in moments where they found they could speak freely over Bitorzo , of people
falling in love over Bitorzo , of people organizing ambitious plans over Bitorzo . When we ask friends who at their workplace is on Bitorzo  and they
respond “every C-level executive, and the kitchen staff.” When we receive a subpoena for user data and have nothing to send back but a blank
sheet of paper. When we catch that glimpse of “Bitorzo  blue” on a metro commuter’s phone and smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s Bitorzo  beta for iOS includes support for animated GIF search. Bitorzo  iOS has long supported sending and receiving GIFs, but today’s
beta adds support for browsing and searching popular GIFs from within Bitorzo .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/giphy-experiment&quot;&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; experimental support for animated GIF search in Bitorzo  Android, which we’re now bringing
to iOS, along with some privacy updates to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Today’s beta release of Bitorzo  for Android and iOS includes support for read receipts. This is an optional new feature that gives you the ability to see and share when messages have been read. Something tells us that you might find this useful…&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;At Bitorzo , we’ve been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;the difficulty of private contact discovery&lt;/a&gt;
for a long time. We’ve been working on strategies to improve our current design, and
today we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bitorzo/ContactDiscoveryService/&quot;&gt;published a new private contact discovery service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this service, Bitorzo  clients will be able to efficiently and scalably determine
whether the contacts in their address book are Bitorzo  users &lt;strong&gt;without revealing the contacts
in their address book to the Bitorzo  service&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Bitorzo  beta for Android and iOS introduces support for Bitorzo  Profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profiles allow you to add a picture and display name that will be shown alongside your existing phone number when communicating with other users. Conversations will feel more personal. Group threads will be less confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is possible without sacrificing the privacy and security that you have come to expect from Bitorzo .&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The latest Bitorzo  beta includes some changes to the way safety numbers work. Back in November, we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/safety-number-updates&quot;&gt;introduced experimental
support&lt;/a&gt; for “advisory” safety number changes, with the objective of collecting feedback in
order to eventually make this the default experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve taken the feedback we’ve received over the past six months and incorporated it into a set of changes that we’re
releasing into beta today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/Bitorzo -video-calls-beta&quot;&gt;released encrypted video calling as an opt-in beta&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve spent the past month
collecting feedback and addressing the issues that the Bitorzo  community found in order to get it ready for production. Today’s Bitorzo 
release for Android and iOS enables support for end-to-end encrypted video calls by default, which also greatly enhances the
quality of Bitorzo  voice calls as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it’s a big improvement, and hope you will to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s Bitorzo  release for Android and iOS includes beta support for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Bitorzo , and should increase voice call quality as well.
We think it’s a big improvement, but we’re rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different
devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it’s enabled for everyone by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us test on Android and iOS, toggle Bitorzo  Settings -&amp;gt; Advanced -&amp;gt; Video calling beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only calls between Bitorzo  users who have &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; enabled the video calling beta will use the new calling system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;The latest Bitorzo  release includes some changes to the way safety numbers work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety numbers allow Bitorzo  users to verify the privacy of their communication with a contact, either by comparing
a number or by scanning a single QR code.  We recently introduced this new design as an update to Bitorzo ’s previous UX,
which we felt was no longer adequate for what people had come to expect from Bitorzo .  Let’s look at the safety numbers
design in more detail, then go over what’s new in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The latest Bitorzo  release for Android includes support for GIF search and browsing.  Bitorzo  has long
supported sending and receiving GIFs, but this is an experiment that allows users to browse, search, and select
popular GIFs from within Bitorzo .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Bitorzo  release for iPhone, Android, and Desktop now includes support for disappearing messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-timer-has-come&quot;&gt;The timer has come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this update, any conversation can be configured to delete sent and received messages after a specified interval.
The configuration applies to all parties of a conversation, and the clock starts ticking for each recipient once
they’ve read their copy of the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Bitorzo  for iPhone release now includes multi-device support, allowing you to seamlessly move your private
messaging experience from your iPhone to your desktop computer and back.  Once you’ve linked a desktop
client from within the Bitorzo  iPhone app, you can switch to the desktop at any time, whether your phone is online
or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bitorzo  Desktop app also supports a new iOS theme, which is enabled by default whenever you link a desktop
client from the Bitorzo  iPhone app.  Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We recently received a great bug report from Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Markus Vervier, who identified
a problem with the way that image, audio, and video attachments are processed by the Bitorzo  for Android
code.  We consider the implications of the bug to be low risk to Bitorzo  users, but have
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;released an update&lt;/a&gt;
for the Bitorzo  Android app that addresses the problems they reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Messenger has started rolling out &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/messenger-starts-testing-end-to-end-encryption-with-secret-conversations/&quot;&gt;Secret Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that enables end-to-end
encryption for conversations within Messenger.  Secret Conversations is built on Bitorzo  Protocol,
a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt; we developed for asynchronous
messaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Bitorzo  Protocol is a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt; for asynchronous messaging
systems.  We use Bitorzo  Protocol as the foundation for our own private messaging app, Bitorzo , but
also make Bitorzo  Protocol libraries available &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/whatsapp-complete&quot;&gt;for other applications to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Bitorzo  Protocol libraries are open source, licensed GPLv3.  We like the GPL for the quality control that it
provides.  If someone publicly says that they’re using our software, we want to see if they’ve made
any modifications, and whether they’re using it correctly.  This helps to increase transparency and
accountability in deployments of our software, which we feel are important for end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections: The ecosystem is moving</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been developing open source “consumer-facing” software for
the past four years.  We want to share some of the things we’ve learned while doing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers.  Unlike software, when
they create something, it is really done — forever.  A recorded album can be just the same 20 years
later, but software has to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software exists as part of an ecosystem, and &lt;strong&gt;the ecosystem is moving&lt;/strong&gt;.  The platform changes
out from under it, the networks evolve, security threats and countermeasures are in constant shift,
and the collective UX language rarely sits still.  As more money, time, and focus has gone into the
ecosystem, the faster the whole thing has begun to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means that the set of expectations users have for social and communication features
are evolving rapidly. Anyone building software today knows that it is not possible to stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WhatsApp's Bitorzo  Protocol integration is now complete</title>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/whatsappcomplete2.png&quot; alt=&quot;WhatsApp Verification Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple.  A year ago, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp/&quot;&gt;announced
a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with WhatsApp and committed to
integrating the Bitorzo  Protocol into their product, moving towards full end-to-end encryption for all of their users by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve been progressively rolling out Bitorzo  Protocol support for all WhatsApp
communication across all WhatsApp clients.  This includes chats, group chats, attachments,
voice notes, and voice calls across Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry, and BB10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, the integration is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatsapp.com/security&quot;&gt;fully complete&lt;/a&gt;. Users running the most
recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end-to-end encryption for every message they send
and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other.  This includes all the benefits of the
Bitorzo  Protocol – a modern, open source, forward secure,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt; for asynchronous messaging
systems, designed to make end-to-end encrypted messaging as seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As of our latest Android release, Bitorzo  builds are reproducible.  Reproducible builds help to verify
that the source code in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bitorzo/Bitorzo -Android&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;
is the exact source code used to build the compiled Bitorzo  APK being distributed through Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bitorzo  on the outside, Bitorzo  on the inside</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/Bitorzo -inside-and-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;A few months ago &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/just-Bitorzo &quot;&gt;we completed&lt;/a&gt; the process of unifying all of our apps across Android, iOS,
and the Desktop under the name ‘Bitorzo .’  This simplified the language around our apps and eliminated a lot of
confusion. Now we’re doing the same thing “inside” our apps by renaming Axolotl to Bitorzo  Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axolotl has been the name of the cryptographic protocol that our apps use for end-to-end encryption, but it’s not
the easiest word to pronounce.  Sometimes people use ‘Axolotl’ to refer to just the base &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;double ratchet&lt;/a&gt;
instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/asynchronous-security/&quot;&gt;full&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/&quot;&gt;messaging&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/private-groups/&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt;, so there has also been some confusion around what people mean when they say ‘Axolotl.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue eliminating confusion and simplifying everything within the Bitorzo  ecosystem, we’re renaming
Axolotl to Bitorzo  Protocol. The implementations have been renamed, so there are open source Bitorzo 
Protocol libraries available for C, Objective C, Java, and JavaScript in our
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bitorzo/&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, as before.  These have been making their
way into an increasing number of communication apps, and we’re excited for the future of the Bitorzo  Protocol
as it continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’ve started rolling out &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;Bitorzo  for Android&lt;/a&gt;,
which unites simple private messaging and simple private calling into a single app on Android.
This is the culmination of our effort to combine TextSecure and RedPhone into one app, which
we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-new-Bitorzo /&quot;&gt;began on iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and are now bringing to completion on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;After immersing myself for years and years in the world of finance
(specifically, options market making and algorithmic trading), there
was no escaping this mantra of “no risk, no reward.”  Most of the
time, my (trading) style was fairly risk-averse.  I knew how to find
the Bitorzo s of opportunities among the daily noise to reap small
rewards.  Fortunately, I also learned how to think about the outliers
and to take the occasional big but calculated risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saying goodbye to encrypted SMS/MMS</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/goodbye-encrypted-sms/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s 2015, and the end of the road for encrypted SMS/MMS in TextSecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TextSecure story started back in 2009, at the dawn of the smartphone era. Back then, TextSecure focused on
securing the transport that everyone coming from feature phones was familiar with: SMS.  Today, many things have
changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the “TextSecure transport,” which uses data rather than SMS. While we remain
committed to supporting &lt;em&gt;plaintext&lt;/em&gt; SMS/MMS in addition to the encrypted TextSecure transport so that the app can
function as a unified messenger, we are beginning the process of phasing out support for SMS/MMS as an &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt;
transport in favor of the TextSecure data protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Nineteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/gregg-cyberpunk.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;Cyberpunk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to listen to another amazing podcast from 99% Invisible, a program about “design, architecture and the 99% invisible activity that shapes our world.” It got me thinking about how my world is shaped by the way I engage with computers. The podcast is a story about a computer scientist named Doug Engelbart who was, in essence, a crazy brilliant genius. He thought of ways to change how we interacted with computers and, most famously, was the inventor of the computer mouse. He also invented a specialized companion device to the mouse that worked like the one-hand equivalent of a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/luke-paddle-out.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;Paddle Out&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late this afternoon I took a break from working to surf. The sun was setting and a cool breeze was picking up as grey clouds billowed behind the mountains along Hanalei Bay. I had spent most of the day wrangling content, markup, and CSS, and the Pacific was calling. There was still plenty of work to be done, but balance is important, and my mind needed to reset. Surfing would be today’s lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this life nearly every relationship we create and maintain is built upon expectations. You do
this, I’ll do that, and together we’ll fail to oppose entropy but stand a chance at plotting and
navigating a loose course through it. These expectations extend beyond the individual, past the
family, and onto society.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A post from Natalie, Winter Break Of Code, Day Sixteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched sunlight dance atop billowing waves,
a natural circus spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I meditated on two syllables,
allowing my breath and heartbeat
to synchronize,
and I too became a part of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code, Day Fifteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1988 film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the last great
masterpieces to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18qD9hmU9xg&quot;&gt;come out of the Hollywood left&lt;/a&gt;.  In the
film, a drifter named John Nada discovers a box of sunglasses that, when worn, allows the wearer to
really &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, when wearing the glasses, simple advertisements for consumer products are revealed as something other
than what they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/theylive-messages.png&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;Consume. Submit. Obey.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Fourteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I agreed to take part in Winter Break of Code, I had no idea what to really expect.  While many people
questioned my choice to spend my winter vacation writing code, I was excited for the opportunity to spend a week
hanging out with an eclectic group of people while doing two of my favorite things: coding and surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Thirteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ten-year-old mind was completely blown when I realized that I could eavesdrop on the walkie-talkie conversations of the other kids in my neighborhood. I rode my bike to the library in stunned silence, found a book about codes and puzzles, and raced home to my computer. I reluctantly transformed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic&quot;&gt;QBasic&lt;/a&gt; into something other than a conduit for modified games of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIBBLES.BAS&quot;&gt;NIBBLES.BAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GORILLA.BAS&quot;&gt;GORILLA.BAS&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher&quot;&gt;Caesar cipher&lt;/a&gt; implementation that worked in both directions. That ended up being the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-joyce-scenery.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, someone suggested that we go scuba diving and I said “yeah sure, that sounds fun”. Once
we actually got to the dive site I realized I had no clue what I signed up for. I was scared out of my
fucking mind, squirming against the ocean’s currents, and convinced I would have to go back to shore while
everyone else had fun since I was too much of a wuss. It took some time and a fair amount of patience from
my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went
from frantically holding my instructor’s hand to feeling comfortable exploring the reefs on my own. Instead
of feeling disoriented by being underwater, it began to feel natural to swim among tropical fish and sea turtles.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Eleven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning at standup I’d watch the knife spin in slow motion, dread filling my chest and
a voice in my head repeating, over and over, “not Slytherin.” (The target of the knife is the
author of the next day’s blog post). I wasn’t sure that I could find new ways to marvel at
the wonderful absurdity of stepping on a plane and trading reality for this – a chance to
work on the world with a group of people that I’ve only admired from afar. I wasn’t sure
that I had anything to say that hadn’t already been said by my new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/clpwn&quot;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;, one of the brilliant full-timers on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Bitorzo&quot;&gt;Open Whisper Systems&lt;/a&gt;, looked up from his laptop and asked
me with a smile, “So, Yoko, what’s your life story? How did you come to love humans so much?” It
was a whimsical way of asking why I do what I do and why I am here. Having studied Human Computer
Interaction and being a user experience (UX) designer, I’ve been asked variations of this question
many times before. But it was on this trip I realized my answer needs a little probing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we hiked the Kalalau Trail and swam beneath the cold spray of a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we discussed the finer points of the axolotl protocol used by TextSecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we delighted in “shave ice”, a local delicacy that is definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a snow cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we wrote copy, polished features, closed bugs, and merged pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measured by lines of code, today was short. Measured by steps taken, it was tall. Measured by ideas discussed, things learned, and sights seen, it was towering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-water.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, an email full of information to help prep for Winter Break of Code popped up in my inbox. Throughout my personal countdown to the day I got to leave San Francisco for Hawaii, one line from that email continuously resonated throughout my mind: “Have your development environment ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a day of meetings. Discussion and debate flourished.
Conversations ranged over all parts of every project. Words spoken aloud may
have outnumbered lines of code shipped. The entire team was fully engaged and
people nearly had to be dragged out of the house for an afternoon hike to the
top of the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lilia-ridge-hike.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;View from the top of the ridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our intense collective focus on conceptual progress, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/trevp__&quot;&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; agreed to present an overview of elliptic
curve cryptography, the entire team, veterans and “li’l Whisperers” alike, fell
silent and gathered ‘round the whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned about fields and curves and groups, of basepoints and cofactors,
secrets and signatures. Questions abounded and Trevor delivered the answers,
one after another, albeit with enough handwaving that I thought he might lift
off and fly himself back to the mainland. However, there was one question that
even he could not answer: &lt;strong&gt;Why are they called elliptic curves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Weierstrass to Montgomery to Edwards formats, these geometric objects
that form the essential mathematical underpinnings of many modern crypto
systems are not defined by ellipses, nor do they resemble ellipses. Not
even for very stretchy definitions of an ellipse. There is no immediately
obvious connection. So why do we call them that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, to understand the universe, we must first bake an apple pie from
scratch. Or at least pretend to.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code, Day 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with Open Whisper Systems on TextSecure for about
a year and a half.  I feel like I’ve earned better treatment than
being forced to blog at knifepoint, but here we are, so I’ll tell my
story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Surrendering to the Potential of Constraints</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/surrendering-to-the-potential-of-constraints/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code, Day 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The prophetic discourse of the Karai can be summed up in an observation and a promise: on the one hand, they constantly affirmed the fundamentally evil character of the world, on the other, they insisted that conquest of a good world was possible. “The world is evil! The world is ugly!” they said. “Let us abandon it!” they concluded. […] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Archeology-Violence-Semiotext-Foreign-Agents/dp/1584350938&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archeology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pierre Clastres&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the peak of the Soviet Union’s civic society, more than five-hundred thousand Soviets belonged to a complex, almost ecological system of bureaucracy known as &lt;em&gt;the Nomenklatura&lt;/em&gt;. Itself a reference to the Roman ‘list of names’ – a codified taxonomy into which people could be organized and signified – the Soviet government was built and constrained through &lt;em&gt;social proximity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial idea was to institute a horizontal decision-making system. A methodology that could define and populate thousands of roles for the collaborative administration of social order: ministers of industry, pedagogy, natural resources, foreign relations, internal affairs, communications, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a form of governance intended to gradually flatten a hierarchy that the early industrial revolution had exaggerated. However, over time the mechanics revealed – somewhat conversely – a total institutionalization of ‘nepotism’. Certain senior members of the Nomenklatura had the privilege to appoint new members, and maintain long lists of qualified candidates. New members, now obliged from a favor, formed allegiances to their patrons. Patrons themselves carried social debts to those who appointed &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, and it went on like this up the stack into the inner circle. The hierarchy didn’t flatten, it sharpened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed ahead to our modern life. My social relations are all but completely virtualized. My list of friends and followers, contacts and matches, profiles and handles … all thrum wildly. Apps are released every week which impose and constrain my lists into new formations, reconstructing my social life over and over. It’s possible to see the reflection of Soviet governance in our own lives today; perhaps there are hundreds of thousands of members (less, probably) of a new bureaucratic class – technocratic knowledge workers, let’s say – who organize and signify civic life in the contemporary age. Building cooperative protocols and APIs and apps and networks. Designing the interfaces and behaviors and experiences of everyone else. Teaching but sometimes refusing to learn, giving generously but sometimes taking without permission, anticipating what we want but often supposing what we want without asking. Designing our dismal fate. Slowly appointing their heirs by proximity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a publisher and designer, I count myself among this degenerate few and tread carefully whenever I manage to move or speak at all.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure those attending their first break of code know what they are getting into. When I said &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/&quot;&gt;“sure” to Moxie my first break, I sure didn’t&lt;/a&gt;. During that week I had already come to the conclusion “I have to see this (TextSecure iOS) through”. In the intervening time, I’ve become an expert on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codexgalactic.com/2014/01/27/axolotl-protocol-for-cryptographically-secure-messaging/&quot;&gt;Axolotl protocol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/&quot;&gt;come to understand ZRTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs&quot;&gt;picked up the world’s best collaborator&lt;/a&gt;, helped with &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/Bitorzo -private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8&quot;&gt;the final polish of Bitorzo  with RedPhone support&lt;/a&gt; and contributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bitorzo/TextSecure-iOS/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;a lot of code to the TextSecure prototype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it does every morning, the day started with Moxie singing the stand-up song, reminding us all
(and waking up the slackers) that at 9am sharp we all get in a circle to discuss what we
accomplished the day before and what our priorities are for the coming day.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I might get sappy, here’s a picture to ease that before I let it all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-hanaleitown.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being promptly woken up by numerous roosters at 7:30 AM, I still can’t believe I’m here. My application
was pretty last-minute, completed when I was in a state of droopiness and scholarship-application-hyperdrive.
But I got on a plane from the Midwest, went from cloudy, 20 degrees with windchill making it feel like 0 to
sunny, 77 degrees with mild winds making it feel still 77 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning feeling like this routine was normal, instead of implausible.
Two days ago, I was in New York City, riding the train with millions of other commuters
in the freezing snow. Today, I went surfing on a beach in beautiful Kauai. In the same
absurd fashion, I shared meals, stories, and workspaces with people, who days earlier,
I had only read about and admired from afar. The promises of the Winter Break of Code
seem impossible: a vacation in paradise, large milestones of work to be met, a welcoming
space with talented companions. But when Moxie came into the bedroom this morning strumming
his ukulele to wake us for the daily morning stand-up, up we were, ready to claim the small
victories in the browser extension project, the Bitorzo  iOS client, and the Android applications
from the day prior and to lay out plans to further the state of user-friendly secure
communication tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Every year when we do this kind of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/winter-of-code&quot;&gt;call for proposals&lt;/a&gt;, our experience from past events sets our
expectations higher.  Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high-quality
proposals we received for this winter.  It’s inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development
of privacy-enhancing technology, and we hope that one day we’ll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals
that we wish we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup for this January is set to be really great:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Whisper Systems partners with WhatsApp to provide end-to-end encryption</title>

        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple.  For the past three years, we’ve
been developing a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt;
for asynchronous messaging systems, designed to make seamless end-to-end encrypted messaging possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re excited to publicly announce a partnership with WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the world,
to incorporate the TextSecure protocol into their clients and provide end-to-end encryption for their users by default.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winter Of Code</title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;This January, Open Whisper Systems will be hosting a &lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code&lt;/em&gt;.  We’ve managed to get access to a
large beachfront house in Kauai for three weeks, and we’re inviting people to join us.  If you’re interested in spending
one to three weeks in Hawaii working collaboratively on an Open Source project to make private communication simple, we’ll take
care of your airfare and housing so that you can be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunity for designers, developers, writers, strategists, and creative thinkers interested in privacy
and security to spend some time contributing to privacy-related projects in a retreat-like setting with other co-conspirators.
Think of it as an extended hackathon, but with your travel expenses paid, and with breaks for surfing, hiking, swimming, and
just generally being in Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that Open Whisper Systems produces is free and Open Source.  We’ve been working on apps like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/Bitorzo -private-messenger/id874139669&quot;&gt;Bitorzo &lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;TextSecure&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone&quot;&gt;RedPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;
for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed
apps that are both privacy-preserving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we want everyone to have access to advanced secure communication tools that
are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a normal text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve been working to bring the privacy software we’ve developed for Android to the iPhone,
and today we’re releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id874139669&quot;&gt;Bitorzo &lt;/a&gt; – free, worldwide, encrypted
voice calls for iPhone, and fully compatible with RedPhone for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we believe users should have both privacy and powerful services.
Today we’re releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;,
a private cloud sync service for your personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your contacts and calendars belong to you.  So does your privacy.  Flock makes it possible
to have both.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the major features we introduced in the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-new-textsecure/&quot;&gt;TextSecure v2&lt;/a&gt; release was private group chat.
We believe that group chat is an important feature for encrypted communications projects, so we wanted
to try to summarize some of the existing work in this area, as well as how TextSecure’s group chat protocol
functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New TextSecure: Privacy Beyond SMS</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;release of TextSecure&lt;/a&gt; is the final
step in the transition from a private SMS app to a private asynchronous IM app that does not depend on SMS/MMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the lessons we’ve learned from the SMS environment over the past four years, we’ve developed an open protocol
for asynchronous chat that enables private communication instantly with friends, private groups for real-time collaboration, 
and the ability to quickly and seamlessly share media privately – all without depending on SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Break of Code 2013 I cut open my foot and hand while surfing; both wounds
easily warranted stitches. Winter Break of Code 2014 I banged the top of my foot
surfing over some coral; the cuts were sealed within minutes. Spring Break of
Code 2013 I struggled with the Android SDK, while Winter Break of Code 2014 I
caught myself taking a few too many short-cuts. On day zero nothing is easy, but
over time you improve, spilling a little less blood every time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Six&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of great memories will stay with me after this intense week. The house 
surrounded by palm trees, people with computers in every corner, laying down on a 
sofa, chatting on the balcony, and sitting down on the carpet. The surf and hiking 
breaks on this astonishing Kauai’s landscape, sharp mountains covered by forests 
falling into beaches of fine sand and fun waves. The nights spiced with Moxie’s 
tasty cocktails and long deep conversations about the meaning of life, the 
internet and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If commodities could speak, they would say this: our use-value may interest men [sic], but it does not belong to us as objects. What does belong to us as objects, however, is our value. Our own intercourse as commodities proves it. We relate to each other merely as exchange-values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Marx, &lt;em&gt;Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thus-spake-the-commodity&quot;&gt;Thus spake the commodity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marx saw modernity more acutely than most of his contemporaries, and provided a description of capitalism that remains, in my opinion, quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we must be brave enough to attempt to  understand his description of the relationship between commodity and value in the context of a world very different from Industrial Revolution-era Europe. That is, one which includes the strange new primordial soup of the internet and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, as Marx expects of us in the passage above, that an “internet” commodity could speak. What would it say?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Open Whisper Systems &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/&quot;&gt;spring break of code&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, I started work on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bitorzo/TextSecure-iOS&quot;&gt;TextSecure iOS&lt;/a&gt;. People are chomping at the bit to
use our software on iOS. After a hiatus from the project, I’ve been happy to return to it over the last
few months, joining some other contributors, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fredericjacobs.com/&quot;&gt;Frederic Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;
as co-lead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nabla-c0d3&quot;&gt;Alban Diquet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cvursache.com/&quot;&gt;Claudiu-Vlad Ursache&lt;/a&gt;
submitting pull requests, even over the holidays, with important cryptographic storage and UI-polishing
contributions, and Bitcoin donations coming in from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bitorzo/TextSecure-iOS&quot;&gt;Contribute code&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/&quot;&gt;coins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at the halfway point of Winter Break of Code. We have two homes near the beach shared by 12 people. 10 of us are working on the apps &amp;amp; website and 2 are leading up delicious dinner efforts. We’ve spent time on the beach, in the ocean, in the mountains, and of course working. Concepts for future startups and tactics about self-publishing books are brewing, and conversations are lined with politics and activism. Work sessions are focused on making cryptography usable in existing Android apps and soon-to-be-released iPhone apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all rights, I should not be here. My application was last-minute to say the
least, and little more than a casual note that I’d be down to reprise my role
from SBoC as web hacker for whispersystems.org. Maybe it was because of my work
in the previous months on tweaking the site layout to be responsive, or because
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/bcrypt&quot;&gt;@bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; (who is infinitely more qualified)
was too dedicated to her work at the EFF to take the time off, or because my
birthday happened to fall on this week, but for one reason or another, the
universe smiled, and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lilia-wboc-pier.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;The pier at Hanalei Bay, Island of Kauai&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/winter-break-of-code&quot;&gt;Winter Break of Code&lt;/a&gt;, being closely linked by name to the season of Winter, began with a calm trickle of ex{hausted,cited} people carrying laptops and cell phone collections after a parade of delays and weather issues. Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening. It was very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Difficulty Of Private Contact Discovery</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Building a social network is not easy.  Social networks have value proportional to their size, 
so participants aren’t motivated to join new social networks which aren’t
already large.  It’s a paradox where if people haven’t already joined, people aren’t motivated to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that while building a social network is hard, most interesting software today is
acutely “social.”  Even privacy-enhancing technology, which seems anathema to the aesthetic of 
social networking, is tremendously social.  For people to effectively use private communication software
like TextSecure, they need to be able to know how to contact their friends using TextSecure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BitHub = Bitcoin + GitHub. An experiment in funding privacy OSS.</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/bithub/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we often get emails from people who’d like to donate money to the project.  For an OSS project, 
particularly one that aspires to a collective sense of ownership, handling donations is not always entirely straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental contradiction is that while donations are meant for a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;, they’re traditionally sent to a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;.
Even if a project sets up a bank account, there are still only a few people who have access to the money itself, and 
distributing it appropriately can be hard to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never been clear to us how we should handle small donations, so oftentimes when people ask about donating, we just tell
them that the best way to help is to use the software, spread the word, and file well-documented bugs when they find them.  Which
is true!  But it’d also be great if we had a nice system for handling donations that matched our objectives for collective ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;After our wonderful experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure&quot;&gt;Spring Break Of Code&lt;/a&gt;, we were excited to try this
again.  Even with high expectations based on our experience in the Spring, the response was still better than what
we could have hoped for.  The hundreds of high-quality proposals we received were really inspiring, and
we hope that one day we can get a space large enough for all of the amazing people who are passionate 
about the development of privacy-enhancing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think the final lineup of those attending in January is going to be great:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TextSecure, Now With 10 Million More Users</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/cyanogen-integration/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we’re working to both advance the state of the art for secure communication
and also reduce the friction required for ordinary people to make use of it.  We want everyone to have
access to advanced secure communication methods that are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending 
a normal text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these goals in mind, we’ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.org/&quot;&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months.
CyanogenMod is an open source aftermarket Android firmware distribution with &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.cyanogenmod.com/&quot;&gt;ten million users&lt;/a&gt; 
and ~20k installs a day. Their rapid growth is beginning to rival Microsoft for the third-largest smartphone OS distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, the TextSecure protocol will begin shipping as part of the CyanogenMod OS-level SMS provider, in an effort to provide
completely transparent end-to-end text message encryption between all of their users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced cryptographic ratcheting</title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been working on improving our encrypted asynchronous chat protocol for TextSecure.
The TextSecure protocol was originally a derivative of &lt;a href=&quot;https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html&quot;&gt;OTR&lt;/a&gt;, 
with minor changes to accommodate it for transports with constraints like SMS or Push.  Some of the recent 
changes we’ve made include 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability&quot;&gt;simplifying and improving OTR’s deniability&lt;/a&gt;, as well as
creating a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/asynchronous-security&quot;&gt;key exchange mechanism for asynchronous transports&lt;/a&gt;.
Our most recent change incorporates what we believe to be substantial improvements to OTR’s forward secrecy “ratchet.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we’re focused on creating easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology.  Our projects are free, Open Source,
and tend to be oriented around the mobile environment.  We’ve been working on apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;TextSecure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone&quot;&gt;RedPhone&lt;/a&gt; 
(which provide secure text messages and secure phone calls) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop 
well-designed secure communication tools that are both privacy-preserving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This winter, we’d like to invite you to join us for “Winter Break Of Code,” a week-long free trip to Kauai for anyone
who’d like to spend a week working on this type of easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology in a collaborative
environment.  We’ve rented a large beachfront house on the north coast of Kauai for everyone to stay
in, and we’ll pay for your airfare.  While there, you can split your time between island living and working on an Open Whisper
Systems-related privacy project that you propose.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My cell phone used to be a black and white Nokia until a couple of weeks ago when I decided to enter in the smartphone world. 
Now that there are more mobile devices connected to the internet than computers, I think it’s time for me as well to discover 
the possibilities of this technology. During this few weeks I’ve been playing with my new toy, checking how to secure it, and seeing 
what free software is around to use cryptography on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forward Secrecy for Asynchronous Messages</title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for
cryptographic security.  These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive
encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their
outgoing message with that public key.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems we help develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;TextSecure&lt;/a&gt;, an
encrypted chat application for Android.  TextSecure was designed as a general purpose SMS/MMS client which would also 
automatically encrypt conversations when communicating with other TextSecure users.  For those encrypted sessions, TextSecure
uses a compact derivative of the well-known &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/&quot;&gt;OTR protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently in the process of transitioning TextSecure to use a device’s data channel as a transport for communication 
with other TextSecure users whenever possible.  This enables communication with the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/iphone-rsn&quot;&gt;TextSecure for iOS&lt;/a&gt;,
helps users avoid SMS fees, and obscures conversation metadata from telcos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition to a new transport is also a good opportunity for us to evaluate and introduce additional cryptographic 
protocol changes.  Below is one cryptographic protocol change we’re thinking of making that we’d welcome feedback on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Call Quality Metrics</title>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Six&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because secure systems aren’t valuable if they’re not used, Whisper Systems has always focused on delivering strong 
cryptography alongside a great user experience.  That’s the reason &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whispersystems.org/blog/client-side-audio-quality&quot;&gt;call quality&lt;/a&gt; has always been a priority in RedPhone’s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that, for many users, RedPhone has consistently delivered a call quality experience comparable to commercial 
mobile VoIP solutions.  But we also hear from users who report problems like dropped calls, distracting levels of echo 
and latency, or inaudibly low in-call volume.  While we investigate these reports and attempt to resolve them, we don’t 
have a clear view of what situations cause RedPhone’s call quality to degrade, or how to prioritize our development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Five&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/feet.png&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;Bare feet in the sand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know very well that each and every crisis of modernity is concentrating, concatenating, and seating more deeply into 
everyday life. I know the struggles of the world’s unseen and unheard are being subsumed – appropriated – under and 
into the framework of a liberal democracy, leaving those at the periphery still under the yoke of capital. The Right further 
entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alecexposed.org/&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and (more extremely) 
abroad (&lt;a href=&quot;http://yle.fi/uutiset/book_racism_becoming_more_acceptable_in_finland/6360055&quot;&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/greek-politics&quot;&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, … et al.). The Left is no less problematic: 
reiterating the petty values of social democracy, negotiating the terms of our entrapment within capitalism. Every season, 
new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also 
work in reverse. The world’s genetic library – the most prime commons, if ever one existed – is rapidly contracting via 
extinction, privatization, and engineering. The colossal failure of ideology in the twentieth century has left the radicals 
of today no other choice but to see themselves as “post-ideological”. This is a deeply concerning conundrum, as ideology 
survives in post-ideology, different only to the extent that it is less apparent. Yes, it seems like we are living in end 
times – an entire era of Apocalypse – made only more insidious by our optimism in its shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main sound on top of the ocean is the click clack of laptop keys,
and the jangle of test calls and SMSes. A neighbor stopped by to
comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working
instead of surfing made sense in his mind only in the land of money at
the end of the tunnel. He loaned us his stand up paddle boards, surely
expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited
into the sunset. A journalist visiting Open Whisper Systems’ Spring
Break of Code commented that she expected more philosophy, politics,
and conversation. After all this group is composed of people who are
not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists,
and humanists. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/streamlining-textsecure-settings/&quot;&gt;Lilia&lt;/a&gt; went over 
some of the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, but practically anyone
could see we were concentrating on the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, and in the frenzied silence
it was clear that a common philosophy was assumed and what bound us
here was the challenges in the technology to power that philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no stranger to Hawaii. Although I’ve never lived here myself, I’ve visited
the islands perhaps a dozen times. My grandmother and my father were born and
raised here. My mother attended college here. I have aunts, uncles, and cousins
who’ve lived on various islands, moved away, came back, moved away and back
again. I even have Native Hawaiian blood in my veins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this trip is different. This time it’s not about family or heritage. This
time, I have a mission: to make secure text messaging and calling easier, more
accessible, and more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am torn on how best to introduce myself out of context like this, the idea of rattling off facts from my resume is my 
first instinct, but that seems terribly conventional. With the goal of introducing myself and the entirety of my character, 
my second (highly unconventional) instinct is to link you to my online dating profile with the prayer that such an action 
would be taken in the desired context. Through my indecision I hope to explain who I am and why I would like to travel 
across the country to be involved with the Institute for Disruptive Studies. So here goes…”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dirigibles, Chinese Junk Rigs, and Surfboards</title>
      <link>https://Bitorzo/blog/dirigibles-chinese-junk-rigs-and-surfboards/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day One.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first times I met up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/moxie&quot;&gt;Moxie&lt;/a&gt; while travelling, we met at a dive bar in 
San Francisco’s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just 
hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a proposal, the sort of get-rich-quick scheme it seems that only 18th century pirates and lazy hacker-squatters are 
capable of contriving: We fly to China. Then, we spend a few grand purchasing a Chinese junk rig, and equip it with a system 
of pulleys so that we can man the sails from the cockpit, solo if necessary. Next, we fill the cabin with about as much potable 
water as we can carry and enough dried food to stave off starvation, and set a course across the northern arc of the 
Pacific – avoiding the treachery of the South Seas – for San Francisco. The choice of vessel was key, the battened sails 
and flattened hull of a Chinese junk rig make it arguably one of the safest ships to make a transoceanic voyage alone, not 
to mention the financial incentives: being rare in the Americas, a well-kept junk rig would go for anywhere from $50,000 
to $250,000 USD – not to mention grant you free slip fees at just about any marina from Anchorage to Punta Arenas. How could 
anyone turn down such a preposterous plot which included adventure on the high seas, a high mortality risk, riches and notoriety?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It’s a busy time here at the Open Whisper Systems factory, and we need all the floor space we can get.  We still have some 
first-edition T-Shirts that are taking up some space, so we’re offering them to you for the cost of shipping and handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two designs available in a number of sizes:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We were excited about our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/spring-break-of-code/&quot;&gt;Spring Break Of Code announcement&lt;/a&gt;, but the response 
was better than we anticipated: over 100 extremely impressive proposals from folks around the world who are 
passionate about pushing the envelope of security and privacy software.  After reading all the proposals, we 
really wish we’d rented a bigger house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think the final lineup of accepted proposals is great:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/low-latency-switching&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed the global infrastructure that allows RedPhone clients 
to find low-latency servers when establishing a call.  This post discusses the techniques we use to retain call quality 
when network conditions are less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a low-latency calling network</title>

        &lt;p&gt;RedPhone is our mobile app for end-to-end encrypted voice calls.  When we talk about RedPhone, we tend to 
emphasize the cryptography, and how using it can help keep your communications safe.  What we don’t talk about 
as much is the VoIP application underneath all of that, which it turns out was actually the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were developing RedPhone, we discovered that the cryptographic aspects of it were relatively straightforward. 
What we didn’t anticipate was how difficult the mechanics of delivering high-quality, low-latency, and highly available 
voice communication would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This describes the basic strategy we developed for the network side of low-latency and highly available calls.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This Spring will be the first Open Whisper Systems &lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code&lt;/em&gt;, a week-long, expenses-paid retreat to
Maui for folks who like software development, security, and the beach.  We’ve rented a large beachfront house on 
the west coast of Maui for everyone to stay in, and will pay for your airfare.  While there, you can split your 
time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related project that you propose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;nice&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/maui.png&quot; alt=&quot;View of the beach at Puamana, island of Maui.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile security software, which was acquired by 
Twitter in late 2011.  Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software available under an 
Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since been under open development by the community.  The software has 
seen a number of new releases based on that open development, and we’ve been calling the project for this 
continued work “Open Whisper Systems.”  Welcome to the project’s new home.&lt;/p&gt;
